Performance Analysis
===============================================================================
Purpose:
    - To evaluate product performance over time.
    - To compare yearly sales with the product's average performance.
    - To perform year-over-year (YoY) comparison.
    - To identify increases and decreases in sales.

Tables Used:
    - gold.fact_sales
    - gold.dim_products

Description:
    This script analyzes yearly product performance by calculating total sales
    per year for each product. It compares current sales with the average sales
    of the product and also compares sales with the previous year using window
    functions such as AVG() and LAG(). This type of analysis is commonly used
    to evaluate business growth, detect trends, and measure performance changes
    over time.
